# GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler
This Repo is a Re-Upload of UTMT Scripts that can Decompile just about everything from a ```data.win``` file

Go to [HERE](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) for Undertale Mod Tool, which you need to use these scripts

## About Scripts
So what do specific scripts do?
> idk, but I'll try my best at this

- ```CodeDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Scripts, but is only for games compiled with the ```VM``` option
- ```CodeYYCDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Scripts, but is only for games compiled with the ```YYC``` option
- ```ExtensionDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Extensions
- ```FontDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Fonts
- ```ObjectDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Objects
- ```RoomDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Rooms
- ```ShaderDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Shaders
- ```SoundDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Sounds
- ```SpriteDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Sprites
- ```TileDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all TileSets
- ```YYPDecompiler.csx```: This script creates a project file, ```.yyp```, so you can use the decomp in GameMaker
> I recommend using ```YYPDecompiler.csx``` last

So yes, you need to manaully use all these scripts one after the other to decompile an entire project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These Scripts only seem to support Resource Version 1.0 and 1.1, not the current 2.0 versions, but you can make them work with newer versions

## What Now?
Because UTMT can't read the actual code, you have to code the scripts and objects yourself, so get to work

## Thanks to
- QuantumV, for helping make this Decompiler
- The United Modders Of Pizza Tower Team, for making this Decompiler
- deeboe, for getting these scripts for me

Also the info above might be wrong, since I have no idea how these scripts work, and I'm not even supposed to have these files, but it should be accurate enough
