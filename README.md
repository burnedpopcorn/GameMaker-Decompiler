# GameMaker Stuido 2 Decompiler
This Repo is a Re-Upload of UTMT Scripts that can Decompile just about everything from a ```data.win``` file

## About Scripts
So what do specific scripts do?
> idk, but I'll try my best at this

- ```CodeDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Scripts, but is only for games compiled with the ```VM``` option
- ```CodeYYCDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Scripts, but is only for games compiled with the ```YYC``` option
- ```ExtensionDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Extensions
- ```FontDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Fonts
- ```ObjectDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Objects
- ```RoomDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Rooms
- ```ShaderDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Shaders
- ```SoundDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Sounds
- ```SpriteDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all Sprites
- ```TileDecompiler.csx```: This script extracts all TileSets
- ```YYPDecompiler.csx```: This script decompiles everything mentioned above, but only works with .yyp packages

So yes, you need to manaully use all these scripts one after the other to decompile an entire project

## What Now?
Because this hasn't been updated in a while, it might not work out-of-the-box, so you are going to have to modify scripts and objects in order to have a decent build
